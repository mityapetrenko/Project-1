Team Members:
- Leevie Martin

Project Description:
- Our project will revolve around an end user search.  The user will search for a city and get a comprehensive list of “something”.  

Initially, our idea is to present them with:
- A list of things to do, based on criteria that they’ve selected, for a given city that they’ve searched.
- A picture of the area of the city.  (Google Earth/Map API)

APIs to be used:
- Spotify API
- Google Earth API
- Google Maps API
- Open Map API


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
- Front End 
-- Dmitriy, Trevor

- Back End
-- Robert, Leevie



Future Ideas:
Add popular music based on Spotify:  A list of music styles related to that city/area -- what people in that area are listening to. (Spotify API)
